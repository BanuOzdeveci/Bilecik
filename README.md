I programmed a simple game using Python's turtle module.This game is played with two users. User1 can rotate  with the right and left keys and increase the speed with the up key.Its purpose is to catch green circles.The second user is pinned vertically to the bottom of the screen. It can go sideways with the a and d keys .It tries to hit green circles by firing bullets with the spacebar key.I hope you like it.
